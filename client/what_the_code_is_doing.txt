This project, "VossAgro", is a React-based web application designed to serve as a comprehensive platform for farmers in Ghana. It is built with modern web technologies, including React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router.

The application is divided into several key modules:

*   **Home:** The main landing page that provides an overview of the platform's features and directs users to the different sections.
*   **Marketplace:** A feature that allows users to buy and sell agricultural products. It includes search and filtering capabilities by region.
*   **Funding Hub:** A section that connects farmers with various funding opportunities, including loans, grants, and investments.
*   **Land Access:** A module for finding and leasing farmland.
*   **AI Insight:** A tool that provides data-driven recommendations to farmers, such as crop suggestions based on region, weather data, and market trends.

The application uses a component-based architecture with UI components like `Card` and `Button`. It also integrates the `lucide-react` library for icons. The overall theme is green and white, reflecting the agricultural domain.
